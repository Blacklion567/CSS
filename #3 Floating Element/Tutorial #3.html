				What is a paragraph? Simply put, a paragraph is a collection of
				sentences all related to a central topic, idea, or theme. Paragraphs act
				as structural tools for writers to organize their thoughts into an ideal
				progression, and they also help readers process those thoughts
				effortlessly. Imagine how much harder reading and writing would be if
				everything was just one long block of text. There’s a lot of flexibility
				when it comes to writing paragraphs, but if there’s one steadfast rule,
				it’s this: Paragraphs should relate to one main topic or point. The
				paragraph itself often contains multiple points spanning several
				sentences, but they should all revolve around one core theme. Just as
				sentences build upon each other to communicate the paragraph’s core
				theme, paragraphs work together to communicate the core theme of the
				writing as a whole. That’s the basic idea, but in practice there’s more
				to it. Let’s look at the four main types of paragraphs to learn how and
				when to use them.

			What is a paragraph? Simply put, a paragraph is a collection of sentences
			all related to a central topic, idea, or theme. Paragraphs act as
			structural tools for writers to organize their thoughts into an ideal
			progression, and they also help readers process those thoughts
			effortlessly. Imagine how much harder reading and writing would be if
			everything was just one long block of text. There’s a lot of flexibility
			when it comes to writing paragraphs, but if there’s one steadfast rule,
			it’s this: Paragraphs should relate to one main topic or point. The
			paragraph itself often contains multiple points spanning several
			sentences, but they should all revolve around one core theme. Just as
			sentences build upon each other to communicate the paragraph’s core theme,
			paragraphs work together to communicate the core theme of the writing as a
			whole. That’s the basic idea, but in practice there’s more to it. Let’s
			look at the four main types of paragraphs to learn how and when to use
			them.

			Expository paragraphs Essays, academic papers, and journalistic articles
			mainly use expository paragraphs to thoroughly explain an individual
			point. These paragraphs rely on data, statistics, or citations from other
			sources to present facts and build up to an irrefutable conclusion.

		<p>Descriptive paragraphs
            Common in fiction and certain styles of journalistic or other nonfiction writing, a descriptive paragraph contains various details of the same thing, with each sentence adding new insight. A paragraph in a horror novel might describe how it feels walking around the woods alone; a love letter’s paragraph might focus on the details of your significant other’s eyes. No matter the context, descriptive paragraphs are meant to provide the clearest picture of your subject. </p>
